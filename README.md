1.Project name : Real-World Data Engineering Project with Databricks:

A clear and concise title for your project.
Example: End-to-End Real-World Data Engineering Project with Databricks

2. Project Description
   
   This project demonstrates an end-to-end real-world data engineering pipeline built using Databricks.
   The pipeline includes data ingestion, transformation, modeling, orchestration, validation, and visualization for business intelligence and analytics.
   The goal is to showcase practical data engineering skills using modern tools and frameworks like Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and Databricks Workflows.

3. Features
   - Automated data ingestion from multiple sources (APIs, S3, databases)
- Data cleaning and transformation using Apache Spark
- Delta Lake integration for scalable and reliable data storage
- Star schema data modeling for analytical workloads
- Data validation with Great Expectations
- Dashboard creation using Databricks visualization tools
- End-to-end pipeline orchestration with Databricks Workflows
- CI/CD integration for automated testing and deployment

8. Workflow Explanation
Describe the end-to-end pipeline in detail.

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Raw data is ingested from APIs and cloud storage into the raw Delta Lake layer.
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing are done using Apache Spark.
   - Transformed data is stored in the processed Delta Lake layer.
3. **Data Modeling**:
   - Analytical models (Dim and Fact tables) are created using SQL.
4. **Data Validation**:
   - Great Expectations is used to validate the data's quality.
5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Key insights and metrics are displayed using Databricks Dashboards.

9. Testing
Explain the testing process used in the project.
- **Unit Testing**: Validated individual ETL components using Pytest.
- **Data Validation**: Ensured data quality with Great Expectations checks.
- **Integration Testing**: Verified end-to-end pipeline functionality.

10.Results
Summarize the outcomes or insights gained from the project.
- Improved data processing speed by 30% using Spark optimizations.
- Achieved 99.9% data accuracy through validation checks.
- Provided actionable insights on sales and customer behavior through dashboards.

11.Challenges and Learnings
Share the challenges faced and lessons learned during the project.

- **Challenge**: Handling schema changes in raw data.
  **Solution**: Implemented schema evolution with Delta Lake.
